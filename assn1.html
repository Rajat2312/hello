<p style="color:darkorange;">Dogs are the most loyal pets known.The dog is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae.<br>Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br>Dogs vary widely in shape, size, and colors.They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles.<br> This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."</p>
